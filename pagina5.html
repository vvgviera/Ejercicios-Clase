                <p><strong>Pregunta 12: </strong> Operative Report
				<strong>Preoperative Diagnosis:</strong> Nonfunctioning right kidney with ureteral stricture.
				<strong>Postoperative Diagnosis:</strong> Nonfunctioning right kidney with ureteral stricture.
				<strong>Procedure:</strong> Right nephrectomy with partial ureterectomy.
				<strong>Findings and Procedure:</strong> Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the right flank
				position. Right flank and abdomen were prepared and draped out of the sterile field. Skin incision was
				made between the 11th and 12th ribs laterally. The incision was carried down through the underlying
				subcutaneous tissues, muscles, and fascia. The right retroperitoneal space was entered. Using blunt and
				sharp dissection , the right kidney was freed circumferentially. The right artery, vein, and erter were
				identified. The ureter was dissected downward where it is completely obstructed in its distal extent. The
				ureter was clipped and divided distally. The right renal artery was then isolated and divided between 0
				silk suture ligatures. The right renal vein was also ligated with suture ligatures and 0 silk ties. The right
				kidney and ureter were then submitted for pathologic evaluation. The operative field was inspected, and
				there was no residual bleeding noted, and then it was carefully irrigated with sterile water. Wound
				closure was then undertaken using 0 Vicryl for the fascial layers, 0 Vicryl for the muscular layers, 2-0
				chromic for subcutaneous tissue, and clips for the skin. A Penrose drain was brought out through the
				dependent aspect of the incision. The patient lost minimal blood and tolerated the procedure well. What
				CPT code is reported for this surgery? </p>
